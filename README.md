### 📖 Origin Story

This project originated from [PR #29907](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/pull/29907) submitted to the HashiCorp Terraform AzureRM Provider repository on `June 19, 2025`. To help move the merge forward and make these AI-powered development tools more accessible to the community, the installation infrastructure was moved to this standalone repository on `October 19, 2025`. The tools and patterns here are designed to work seamlessly with the official provider repository while being maintained independently.


## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

**Required VS Code Extensions:**
- [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) - AI code generation
- [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) - Interactive AI assistance
- [HashiCorp Terraform](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HashiCorp.terraform) - Terraform support
- [Go](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go) - Go language support

### Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The installer MUST be extracted to your user profile directory** (`$env:USERPROFILE\.terraform-azurerm-ai-installer\` on `Windows` or `~/.terraform-azurerm-ai-installer/` on `macOS`/`Linux`). Running from other locations (like Downloads or Desktop) will cause directory traversal errors. See [Troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#positional-parameter-error-windows) for details.

### Security And Trust

Before downloading or running the installer, understand the trust boundary:

- The canonical repository identity is `WodansSon/terraform-azurerm-ai-assisted-development`.
- Official release provenance should be verified against `.github/workflows/release.yml` in that repository.
- `checksums.txt` and `aii.checksum` are integrity checks only. They do not, by themselves, prove publisher authenticity.
- A spoofed or cloned repository can publish its own docs, checksums, and attestations for its own identity.
- That means users still need to start from the real canonical repository and verify against that exact pinned repo and workflow.

For pinned release assets, verify provenance before extraction:

```bash
gh attestation verify terraform-azurerm-ai-installer-v1.0.1.tar.gz \
    --repo WodansSon/terraform-azurerm-ai-assisted-development \
    --signer-workflow WodansSon/terraform-azurerm-ai-assisted-development/.github/workflows/release.yml \
    --source-ref refs/tags/v1.0.1
```

**Choose your platform:**

#### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
# Download and extract installer directly to user profile
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/WodansSon/terraform-azurerm-ai-assisted-development/releases/latest/download/terraform-azurerm-ai-installer.zip" -OutFile "$env:TEMP\terraform-azurerm-ai-installer.zip"
Expand-Archive -Path "$env:TEMP\terraform-azurerm-ai-installer.zip" -DestinationPath "$env:USERPROFILE" -Force

# Verify installation
& "$env:USERPROFILE\.terraform-azurerm-ai-installer\install-copilot-setup.ps1" -Help
```

#### macOS/Linux (Bash)
```bash
# Download and extract installer directly to user profile
curl -L -o /tmp/terraform-azurerm-ai-installer.tar.gz "https://github.com/WodansSon/terraform-azurerm-ai-assisted-development/releases/latest/download/terraform-azurerm-ai-installer.tar.gz"
mkdir -p ~/.terraform-azurerm-ai-installer
tar -xzf /tmp/terraform-azurerm-ai-installer.tar.gz -C ~/.terraform-azurerm-ai-installer --strip-components=1

# Verify installation
~/.terraform-azurerm-ai-installer/install-copilot-setup.sh -help
```

> [!NOTE]
> **About `-Verify` / `-verify`:** verification has two modes:
> - **Bundle self-check (no repo directory):** when run from the user-profile installer directory *without* `-RepoDirectory` / `-repo-directory`, it verifies the installer bundle itself (manifest/modules/payload/checksum).
> - **Target repo verification:** when run *with* `-RepoDirectory` / `-repo-directory`, it checks whether the target repository has all required AI files.
> - `-Verify -RepoDirectory` / `-verify -repo-directory` hard-fails if the repo directory points at the installer source repository, to prevent false-positive verification.
> - If it reports **"Manifest file mismatch"**, your local installer manifest is out of date (or from a different release/branch).
>   Re-extract the latest release bundle (recommended), or re-run `-Bootstrap` from a local git clone (contributors only), then run verify again.
> - `-Verify` is offline-only and checks against the local `file-manifest.config` and bundled payload in the installer directory.
> - Verification summaries include both files and directories checked.
<!-- -->
> [!NOTE]
> **Offline-only operations**: install, verify, and clean use the bundled payload (`aii/`) and local manifest. No network downloads occur during these operations.
> Install and verify also validate the bundled payload checksum (`aii.checksum`). If it fails, re-extract the release bundle or re-run `-Bootstrap`.
> This bundle self-check verifies extracted bundle integrity only. It does not prove that the downloaded release asset came from the official release workflow.
<!-- -->
> [!NOTE]
> Target installs require a `terraform-provider-azurerm` clone with an origin remote configured.
> The AI development repository is a source-only workspace and is not a valid install target.
<!-- -->
> [!NOTE]
> **Verify official release provenance**: for pinned release assets, prefer verifying the GitHub artifact attestation before extraction:
> ```bash
> gh attestation verify terraform-azurerm-ai-installer-v1.0.1.tar.gz \
>   --repo WodansSon/terraform-azurerm-ai-assisted-development \
>   --signer-workflow WodansSon/terraform-azurerm-ai-assisted-development/.github/workflows/release.yml \
>   --source-ref refs/tags/v1.0.1
> ```
> `checksums.txt` and `aii.checksum` are still useful, but they are integrity checks, not publisher-authenticity checks.
<!-- -->
> [!NOTE]
> **Install a specific version (pinning)**: replace `latest/download` with a tagged release URL (`download/vX.Y.Z`).
>
> The version is the `vX.Y.Z` segment in the URL path. The filename can be either the stable (unversioned) asset name or the versioned asset name.
>
> - Example pinned URL (stable filename):
>   - `https://github.com/WodansSon/terraform-azurerm-ai-assisted-development/releases/download/v1.0.1/terraform-azurerm-ai-installer.tar.gz`
> - Example pinned URL (versioned filename):
>   - `https://github.com/WodansSon/terraform-azurerm-ai-assisted-development/releases/download/v1.0.1/terraform-azurerm-ai-installer-v1.0.1.tar.gz`
<!-- -->
> [!TIP]
> **For Contributors**: If you're contributing to this AI infrastructure project itself and have the repository cloned locally, the most reliable workflow is:
> 1) **From your local clone**, run Bootstrap to refresh the user-profile installer, then
> 2) run installs from your user profile using `-LocalPath` / `-local-path` to source AI files from your working tree.
> ```bash
> # Step 1 (Bootstrap) - run from your local clone
> cd terraform-azurerm-ai-assisted-development/installer
> ./install-copilot-setup.sh -bootstrap
> # PowerShell:
> #   cd terraform-azurerm-ai-assisted-development\installer
> #   .\install-copilot-setup.ps1 -Bootstrap
>
> # Step 2 (Install) - run from your user profile, sourcing AI files from your working tree
> # PowerShell:
> #   cd "$env:USERPROFILE\.terraform-azurerm-ai-installer"
> #   .\install-copilot-setup.ps1 -LocalPath "C:\path\to\terraform-azurerm-ai-assisted-development" -RepoDirectory "C:\path\to\terraform-provider-azurerm"
> # Bash:
> #   cd ~/.terraform-azurerm-ai-installer
> #   ./install-copilot-setup.sh -local-path "/path/to/terraform-azurerm-ai-assisted-development" -repo-directory "/path/to/terraform-provider-azurerm"
> ```
>
> **Why use Bootstrap instead of the release package?**
> - Tests your uncommitted changes to instruction files, installer scripts, and prompts
> - Copies your local working copy to the user profile installer location
> - Perfect for testing improvements before submitting a PR
>
> Normal users should use the release package download (above) - Bootstrap is only for contributors working on the AI infrastructure itself.

### What the Installer Does

- 🔧 **Installs AI instruction files** to your target repository's `.github/` directory
- 🔧 **Installs Agent Skills** to your target repository's `.github/skills/` directory (invocable via slash commands like `/docs-writer`)
- 🔧 **Configures workspace settings** in `.vscode/settings.json` for AI assistance
- 🔧 **Works per-repository** - each repo gets its own AI infrastructure
- 🔧 **Non-invasive** - doesn't modify your personal VS Code settings

For detailed installation options, see **[installer/README.md](installer/README.md)**


## ⚠️ Important: Development Workflow

**These AI infrastructure files are TEMPORARY development aids and should NOT be committed to the terraform-provider-azurerm repository.**

### Recommended Workflow

```powershell
# 1. Install AI infrastructure on your feature branch
cd ~/.terraform-azurerm-ai-installer
.\install-copilot-setup.ps1 -RepoDirectory "C:\path\to\terraform-provider-azurerm"

# 2. Develop with AI assistance
# (Work on your feature, use GitHub Copilot, get AI guidance)

# 3. BEFORE committing your code changes
.\install-copilot-setup.ps1 -RepoDirectory "C:\path\to\terraform-provider-azurerm" -Clean

# 4. Now commit only your actual code changes
cd C:\path\to\terraform-provider-azurerm
git add <your-files>
git commit -m "Your feature changes"
git push
```

### Why Clean Before Committing?

- ✅ Keeps the terraform-provider-azurerm repo clean
- ✅ Prevents accidental commits of AI instruction files
- ✅ Maintains HashiCorp's repository structure
- ✅ AI files are for YOUR local development only

**📌 Remember**: The AI infrastructure files live in `.github/` directory and other locations. They're meant to enhance your local development experience, not to be pushed to HashiCorp's repository.


## 💡 Usage Examples

### Generate a New Azure Resource
```
AI Chat: "Create a new Azure CDN Front Door Profile resource using typed implementation"
```

### Review Your Changes
```
/code-review-local-changes
```

### Review Committed Branch Changes
```
/code-review-committed-changes
```

If Copilot does not already have PR context for your branch, pass the PR number explicitly:

```
/code-review-committed-changes PR 12345
```

> [!NOTE]
> The generic review prompts assume a recent local `azurerm-linter` binary. If you are testing these prompt-side linter behaviors before the corresponding upstream `azurerm-linter` changes are merged and installed locally, the linter subsection may not yet behave exactly as documented. The current upstream dependency is [QixiaLu/azurerm-linter#50](https://github.com/QixiaLu/azurerm-linter/pull/50). After those upstream changes land, reinstall or update your local `azurerm-linter` binary and rerun the review.

If you want to reduce approval prompts for the harmless repo-root lookup used by the review prompts, you can allow just that command in your VS Code user settings:

```jsonc
"chat.tools.terminal.autoApprove": {
    "/^git rev-parse --show-toplevel$/": true
}
```

This only auto-approves the read-only repo-root command. It does not broadly allow other `git` commands.

### Generate Tests
```
AI Chat: "Create comprehensive acceptance tests for azurerm_cdn_frontdoor_profile"
```

### Generate Documentation
```
AI Chat: "Create documentation following provider standards for azurerm_cdn_frontdoor_profile"
```

> [!TIP]
> For doc pages under `website/docs/**`, use `/code-review-docs` as a tight loop:
> 1) run the audit
> 2) apply the patch-ready fixes
> 3) rerun the audit and expect no repeated Issues
>
> `/code-review-docs` also enforces deterministic doc-quality checks such as `hcl` fences in examples, page-self-contained examples (no undefined references), import example ID shape validation, and human-readable timeout defaults.


## 🎬 See It In Action

### AI-Powered Resource Generation

Watch as GitHub Copilot generates complete Azure resources following HashiCorp standards:

```go
// Just describe what you want, and Copilot generates the implementation
// Example: "Create an azurerm_cdn_frontdoor_profile resource with typed SDK"

type CdnFrontDoorProfileResource struct{}

var _ sdk.Resource = CdnFrontDoorProfileResource{}

func (r CdnFrontDoorProfileResource) ResourceType() string {
    return "azurerm_cdn_frontdoor_profile"
}

func (r CdnFrontDoorProfileResource) ModelObject() interface{} {
    return &CdnFrontDoorProfileModel{}
}

func (r CdnFrontDoorProfileResource) Arguments() map[string]*pluginsdk.Schema {
    return map[string]*pluginsdk.Schema{ /* Complete schema */ }
}

func (r CdnFrontDoorProfileResource) Create() sdk.ResourceFunc {
    return sdk.ResourceFunc{
        Timeout: 30 * time.Minute,
        Func: func(ctx context.Context, metadata sdk.ResourceMetaData) error {
            // Typed resource implementation
            var model CdnFrontDoorProfileModel
            if err := metadata.Decode(&model); err != nil {
                return fmt.Errorf("decoding: %+v", err)
            }
            // ... implementation
        },
    }
}
```

**What You Get:**
- ✅ Complete CRUD operations following HashiCorp patterns
- ✅ Proper error handling with formatted errors
- ✅ Schema with correct types and validation
- ✅ Timeout configurations
- ✅ State management with metadata
- ✅ Azure API integration patterns

### Intelligent Code Reviews

Get instant feedback on your changes:

```
You: /code-review-local-changes

Copilot: Analyzing your changes...

✅ Schema design follows provider patterns
✅ Error handling uses fmt.Errorf with wrapping
✅ CRUD operations properly structured
⚠️  Consider adding validation for 'sku' field
⚠️  CustomizeDiff may be needed for 'tags'
```

Review modes:
- `/code-review-local-changes` reviews local workspace changes and uses local-diff linting.
- `/code-review-committed-changes` reviews branch changes against `origin/main` and prefers PR-scoped linting.
- If committed review cannot determine a valid PR, it reports `Not run` for the linter section and tells you to create a draft PR or rerun with an explicit PR number such as `/code-review-committed-changes PR 12345`.

### Test Generation Made Easy

```
You: "Generate acceptance tests for this resource"

Copilot generates:
- Basic test configuration
- Complete test cases
- Check functions with proper validations
- Import tests
- Update scenarios
```

### Real-Time Best Practice Guidance

As you type, Copilot suggests:
- Correct Azure SDK usage patterns
- Proper state management
- Error handling patterns
- Schema design improvements
