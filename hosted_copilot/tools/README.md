# Hosted Toolkit Commands

Only the commands listed here are supported maintainer entry points. The four normal-operation commands remain at the tools root. Specialized catalog commands live beneath `commands/catalog/`.

Files beneath `internal/`, `modules/`, and `tests/` are implementation or validation details rather than an equivalent manual command surface. Reusable `.psm1` files live under `modules/`; `internal/` is reserved for implementation `.ps1` scripts. Retired migration and version 3 tools are preserved under `local-only-docs/obsolete-v3/`.

## Normal Operations

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Validate the complete Hosted Toolkit | `pwsh -NoProfile -File ./hosted_copilot/tools/Test-HostedRules.ps1` |
| Launch the Hosted Rule Workbench | `pwsh -NoProfile -File ./hosted_copilot/tools/Start-RuleWorkbench.ps1` |
| Plan or install the Hosted payload | `pwsh -NoProfile -File ./hosted_copilot/tools/Install-HostedRules.ps1` |
| Run or resume a controlled Hosted review | `pwsh -NoProfile -File ./hosted_copilot/tools/Invoke-HostedReview.ps1 -RepoDirectory <provider-fork> -CaseId <case-id>` |

Review the command help before supplying operation-specific parameters. Installation defaults to a dry run.

The normal Workbench command automatically reuses validated per-source assessments from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hosted-workbench\assessment-cache` and discovers compatible toolkit-managed artifacts from failed assessment or reconciliation runs. Reconciliation uses each source definition's existing batch size, runs up to three batches concurrently, merges results deterministically, and reports recovery and batch progress during startup. Restart with the same normal command after a failure; use `-AssessmentCacheDirectory`, `-AssessmentResumeDirectory`, `-ReconciliationResumeDirectory`, or `-MaxParallelBatches` only for diagnostic or controlled overrides. Cache entries persist across successful runs, and temporary or recovered run artifacts are removed only after successful completion.

## Catalog Maintenance

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Check generated instruction freshness | `pwsh -NoProfile -File ./hosted_copilot/tools/commands/catalog/Generate-Instructions.ps1` |
| Regenerate approved instruction changes | `pwsh -NoProfile -File ./hosted_copilot/tools/commands/catalog/Generate-Instructions.ps1 -Write` |
| Audit live upstream source drift | `pwsh -NoProfile -File ./hosted_copilot/tools/commands/catalog/Test-UpstreamSources.ps1 -FailOnDrift` |

Live upstream drift is an explicit maintainer audit and is not a deterministic required-CI input.

## Hosted Review

Use [Hosted Review](../docs/HOSTED_REVIEW.md) for the complete local workflow. `Invoke-HostedReview.ps1` creates or resumes a controlled review, exits while GitHub reviews are pending, guides local maintainer adjudication, validates the result, and performs cleanup only with `-Cleanup`.

Review branch topology, evidence capture, and result construction are internal implementation details. Do not invoke scripts beneath `internal/review/` directly.

## Focused Development

Focused tests are invoked while changing their owning implementation and are also composed by `Test-HostedRules.ps1`. They are not normal maintainer operations. Migration-only tools exist solely to prove and complete the version 4 cutover and are removed from normal validation before archival.
